## Getting Started

This is a Graffiticode starter language.

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:51](http://localhost:51) with your browser to a page containing "hello, l1!".

To write L1 web services in the development environment, you need to have Graffiticode running locally. Follow the instructions to run the api and auth servers here (https://github.com/graffiticode/graffiticode) and the console app here (https://github.com/graffiticode/app).
